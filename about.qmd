Hello! Iâ€™m Christy Lai from Hong Kong. 

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Business Analytics while also working as an early childhood teacher.

I genuinely enjoy working with children, as it brings me joy to see their growth and development. However, I also have a strong interest in the business analysis industry.

As I embark on this journey, I look forward to connecting with others who share similar interests and learning from their experiences in the field of business analytics.

## Interests

While I enjoy spending time at home, I also love going hiking with friends.

I find that the outdoors provides a refreshing break. In addition to hiking, I am passionate about sports, particularly swimming and badminton.

I also enjoy playing open-world games such as Genshin Impact, Rune Factory, and Stardew Valley, which allow me to immerse myself in different adventures and stories.
