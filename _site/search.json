The key findings suggest:\n\nCoffee Preferences: Bold, experimental coffees like Coffee D are popular, particularly with younger consumers, while lighter roasts like Coffee A also hold strong appeal.\nConsumer Demographics: Younger males are more likely to experiment with unusual coffee flavors, while older females may prefer more traditional coffee types.\nDrinking Locations: The majority of coffee consumption happens at home, so products that cater to the at-home experience—like specialty beans and brewing tools—are likely to be well-received.\nBrewing Preferences: Pour-over is the most popular brewing method, providing an opportunity for educational workshops or branded products focused on this technique.\nPrice Sensitivity: Most consumers are willing to spend between $6 and $10 for a premium cup of coffee, suggesting there is room for premium pricing.\n\nArmed with these insights, our client can craft a unique brand that resonates with coffee lovers across the U.S., providing both in-shop experiences and products for at-home brewing."
